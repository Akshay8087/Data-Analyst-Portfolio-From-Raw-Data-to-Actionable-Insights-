# Machine Learning for Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive workflow for developing a machine learning model to predict individual medical insurance costs. The primary objective is to accurately estimate insurance charges based on a person's demographic and health-related attributes. The project encompasses the entire data science lifecycle, from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and finally, deployment as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 2. Problem Statement

The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the 'charges' (the target variable) for an individual based on several independent features. This predictive tool can be valuable for insurance companies in risk assessment and for individuals in understanding potential healthcare costs.

## 3. Dataset

The analysis is performed on the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" sourced from Kaggle.

**Dataset Features:**
* **`age`**: Age of the primary beneficiary (Numeric).
* **`sex`**: Gender of the primary beneficiary (Categorical: `male`, `female`).
* **`bmi`**: Body Mass Index, providing a measure of body fat (Numeric).
* **`children`**: Number of children covered by the health insurance (Numeric).
* **`smoker`**: Smoking status (Categorical: `yes`, `no`).
* **`region`**: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (Categorical: `northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`).
* **`charges`**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (Numeric, **Target Variable**).

## 4. Project Workflow

The project follows a structured methodology:

1.  **Data Exploration**: Initial loading and inspection of the dataset to understand its structure, size, and data types.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis and visualization to uncover patterns, distributions, and correlations between features.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Transformation of categorical features (e.g., `sex`, `smoker`, `region`) into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
4.  **Model Training**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the training data as a baseline.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed on the unseen test data using the **R-squared ($R^2$) score**.
6.  **Web Application Development**: A simple and intuitive user interface is built with **Streamlit** to serve the trained model for real-time predictions.

## 6. Setup and Installation

To replicate this project, follow these steps. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-prediction.git](https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-prediction.git)
    cd medical-insurance-prediction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing the necessary libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, etc.)*

## 7. How to Run the Project

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook for analysis and a Streamlit script for the web application.

* **To run the analysis notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction.ipynb"
    ```

* **To launch the web application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Navigate to the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) displayed in your terminal to use the prediction system.

## 8. Model Performance & Results

The Linear Regression model was evaluated on the test set to determine its predictive accuracy.

* **Metric**: R-squared ($R^2$) Score
* **Result**: The model achieved an **$R^2$ score of approximately 0.75**.

This result indicates that the model can explain about 75% of the variance in the medical insurance charges, providing a reasonably strong baseline for this prediction task. The Streamlit application successfully translates this model into a practical tool for generating cost estimations.

## 9. Conclusion and Future Improvements

This project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs and deployed it via a Streamlit web application.

Potential areas for future improvement include:
* **Advanced Model Exploration**: Implementing and comparing more complex regression models such as `Random Forest Regressor`, `Gradient Boosting Regressor`, or `XGBoost` could yield higher accuracy.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employing techniques like `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters for the chosen model.
* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data (e.g., BMI categories, age groups) to potentially improve model performance.
