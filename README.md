# Data Analyst Portfolio: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights 📊.      
         
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository is a collection of my projects, where I turn raw data into meaningful stories and actionable insights. My goal is to showcase my skills in SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Power BI.

I am committed to continuous learning and practical application, which is why I've challenged myself to upload a new project **every two days**. Follow along to see my journey!

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by project. Each project folder is self-contained and follows a consistent structure to make navigation easy:

```bash
├── Project_001_Retail_Sales_Dashboard/
│   ├── data/                 # Raw and cleaned datasets (.csv, .xlsx)
│   ├── sql_scripts/          # All SQL queries for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
│   ├── notebooks/            # Jupyter Notebook for Python-based EDA
│   ├── power_bi/             # Power BI file (.pbix) and images of the final dashboard
│   └── README.md             # Detailed project-specific documentation

## 📝 My General Workflow
Each project in this repository follows a structured data analysis process to ensure thoroughness and accuracy.

1.  **Problem Definition:** I start by understanding the business problem and defining the key questions that need to be answered.
2.  **Data Extraction & Cleaning:** I use SQL to query and extract data from databases. I then perform data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL or Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I dive deep into the data to uncover initial patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
4.  **Insight Generation:** I use advanced SQL queries and logical reasoning to test hypotheses and extract meaningful insights that address the core business questions.
5.  **Visualization & Reporting:** I use Power BI to build interactive and intuitive dashboards that communicate the key findings to stakeholders in a clear and compelling way.
