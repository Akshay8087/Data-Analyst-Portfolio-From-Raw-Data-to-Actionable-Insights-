# ‚úàÔ∏è Indian Domestic Airlines Flight Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of domestic flights within India. The analysis is performed on a dataset scraped from the **EaseMyTrip** website, which captures a snapshot of flight details between major Indian cities.

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and insights related to flight operations, airline market share, pricing strategies, and popular travel routes. The findings are presented through a series of visualizations and data summaries.

## üìä Key Insights from the Analysis

### üõ´ Flight Operations
* **Busiest Airline**: **Vistara** operates the highest number of flights in this dataset, holding the largest market share, followed closely by **Air India**.
* **Most Popular Route**: The route between **Delhi and Mumbai** is the most frequently operated, indicating it's the busiest travel corridor.
* **Peak Timings**: Most flights tend to depart in the **Morning** and arrive in the **Evening** or **Night**.

### üí∞ Pricing Insights
Flight prices are influenced by several factors:
* **Airline Brand & Class**: Full-service carriers like **Vistara** and **Air India** have significantly higher average ticket prices, especially for **Business class**, which is substantially more expensive than **Economy class**.
* **Booking Window (Dynamic Pricing)**: Ticket prices are lower when booked well in advance. As the departure date approaches, prices increase sharply, demonstrating dynamic pricing in action. The price is highest when booking is done just a day or two before departure.
* **Departure/Arrival Time**: Flights departing at **Night** and arriving in the **Evening** tend to have the highest average prices, while "Late Night" flights are the cheapest.
* **Stops**: Direct flights (zero stops) are generally more expensive than flights with one or more stops.

### üë• Passenger Choices
* **Preferred Class**: A vast majority of passengers in this dataset chose **Economy class**, highlighting a strong preference for budget-friendly travel options.
* **Busiest Cities**: **Delhi** and **Mumbai** are the top cities for both flight departures and arrivals.
