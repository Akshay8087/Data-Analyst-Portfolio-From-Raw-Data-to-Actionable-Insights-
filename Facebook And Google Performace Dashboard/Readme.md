## üìñ Executive Summary

This Power BI report provides a comprehensive, unified view of digital advertising performance across Google Ads and Facebook Ads.

## üéØ Business Problem

Marketing departments often allocate significant budgets across multiple ad platforms like Google and Facebook. Managing and analyzing performance data from these disparate sources is challenging, time-consuming, and makes it difficult to get a holistic view of marketing effectiveness. This report solves the following problems:

* **Lack of a Single Source of Truth:** Eliminates the need to manually download reports and switch between different ad manager platforms to gauge overall performance.
* **Difficulty in Comparing Channel ROI:** Provides direct, side-by-side comparisons of cost and conversion metrics (like CPA and ROAS) to determine which platform offers a better return on investment.
* **Inability to Spot Cross-Platform Trends:** Visualizes performance over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns, campaign fatigue, or opportunities for budget reallocation between channels.
* **Time-Consuming Manual Reporting:** Automates the data aggregation and visualization process, freeing up analysts to focus on generating insights rather than building reports.
